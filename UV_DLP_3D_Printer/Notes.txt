ToDo:

Web presense / 
	release FDM plugin
	release SLS limited

Integrate VCG library
http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~cignoni/newvcglib/html/
builds for 32bit x86 on Linux and Windows



2.  Is it possible to select a model and have the software show you the unsupported areas that are hanging down. (Ron B.)
-Find and show lowest point/area in region of model
-manual & automatic intra-object supports
	-match angle of supports better to the surface of the polygon normal

Automatic layout and support generation of scene?

-need faster support generation
	position camera at bottom facing up
	render scene into bitmap,
	render into zbuffer
	test each pixel of zbuffer to associate what polygon it came from

Scene/Object info areas should be merged

Pro Version:
home hobbiest licensce 
	flat fee - 75$

vendor licience 
	per-site cost(unlimited) or per-machine license
	2500$ per year Site license fee
	Pro-fee? Plugin Creation Fee
	
Pro Features:
-Background/theming color control
	per control/button color control
-overlays
-controls on the 3d screen
-add/remove buttons from toolbar
-bind sequences/scripts to buttons
-rearrange/remove controls
-add controls/resources from plugins
-run code from plugins
	sequences
	actual code
	scripts
Load multiple GUI Scripts into CW
	- the 'pro' GUIconfig script loads up the controls for editing other guiconfigs and creating new guiconfigs

-load/unload plugins (code/resources/guis,data,etc...)
-execute sequences of script that can control machines such as gcode or binary interfaces (Generic ascii with binary passthrough)
GUI Editor
	gui editor is in the pro/vendor version
	editor for gcode sequences
	editor for controls/buttons/decals
scripts have:
	if/then/else
	for/next
	while loops
	read variables from hardware into $VARNAME
	send commands to hardware
	set arbitrary $VARNAME varaibles to expressions / numbers
scripts can:
	load/save variables and sequences into XML
	execute other scripts
	map onto program events such as:
		connected
		disconnected
		printstarted
		printstopped
		paused
		cancelled
Common machine sequences:
	Startup
	Shutdown
	Goto home position
	Build/Print position 
Sequences can be defined in the following files:
	Machine profile config files	
		Some sequence examples:
			Machine Connect
			Machine Disconnect
			Special Homing sequnces?
			Set/Recall build home / marker position?
				
	Slicing profile config files
		Some sequences can be:
			Special move / slice sequences
	GUI Config files

	The machine config will have additional controls with the pro version to add /edit seqeunces
	There should be a sequence editor control that can either pop up or be embedded as a control in another composite control
	Sequences should maintain namespaces




General GUI editor
Ability to define sequences, 
	sequences can:
		send /receive data in sequence
		receive data from devices
		use a general-notation script to:
			define variables (doubles)
			perform arithmetic
			perform and/or/xor...

-Change CW to have the ability to load a list of GUIConfigs on startup.
-Tie this into the plugin config screen
- The GUIConfig files can have code that runs on startup/load

-start off the GUI mods with a menu editor
- Sequence editor:
- have the ability to define GCode sequences
		- save sequences in GUIConfig files

- Add the ability to save/load GCode snippets (strings) from XML docs - slicing profile / machine profile
- Add ability for GUIConfig.txt to be loaded from file
- Add the ability for a button in the GUI defined by the GUIConfig.txt file to call a GCode / Build script seqeunce
- Add the ability for a run-time loaded XML script of a build process to use state machine and similar to generate gcode during a build
to interactively build for a scene . This should have the ability to run G/M code commands and read the results into variable that can be used in
the gcode scripts. This can be built into complex structures in the future. This script can be save as a string varaible in an XML file.
This script has a name, and can be called to execute by script.

- Add a height selection for Support bases - just the footer portion
- Make a generic plugin
	XML GUIConfig can set splash, name, basic settings, hash for vendor id
	load the guiconfig.txt file
	load the splash
	use the guiconfig xml configuration to configure various settings.
- When I open the control tab, even though I have the manual control button checked, I cannot seem to get it to show up? <- projecter/gcode tab mixup?
- show which layer # is being exposed 
- print up to a certain layer or %
- start print on a specific layer
- pulsing exposure per layer with user defined pulsing duration and number of pulses per layer
- Re-Write the manual with new screen shots
- Preset GCode commands (Manual Control Window). Or at least an individually selectable list of previous commands to reuse without the need for copy-pasting.
- OnEnter event for the custom GCode txt field, so there is no need to send it using the mouse.
- AutoScroll for the GCode replies

- fix php script to first look for matching machine GUID to update record, if no existing record, add new

- allow importing a set of images (png,bmp) along with a layer height. Generate a GCode file and allow printing from imported.
- Model preview section / additional tab
- Add class to launch/ wait for an external process 
- add additonal anti-aliasing re-sampling options other than bi-cubic.

XML system to add/remove controls in the following areas:
	Top panel
	Top Lower
	Left on 3d view
	Right on 3d view
	in 3d view
	in any of the major panels

1)      Memory problem for support generation:  We import several high resolution models and add supports.   When the number of supports is high,  the imported models will disappear and only the generated supports will remain on the 3D view
2)      Maneuvering the 3D view is slow when the model has higher resolution,  I believe this is caused by the memory problem too
3)      It would be great if you can add side, front, back, top and bottom views to help position the supports accurately
4)      We have tried to create supports in other software and import the stl to creation workshop for slicing.   The overlap regions between the supports and the model do not have a union effect.    Unless we merge all supports with the model into one shell,   the sliced 2D images cannot be used.
5)      Adaptive support generation does not help most of the time,  because removing redundant supports is a pain.   
6)      It would be helpful if a simple 2D editor can be included in the slice view
7)      Is it possible to do for loop or while loop in the G-code?    It is painful to modify parameters layer by layer for more optimized printing. 

better hierchachal xml panels - 
The panels/controls can be defined by coding a new control, or defining xml guidef docs
-part library and view is a nice touch - very handy!

 This autosupport generation can do intra-object supports, as well as a tree-structure
 	
support generation
	Option to generate webbing between supports	
		-based on distance X/Y radius
		-Can occur at regular Z intervals



Skirt/Brim/Raft functionality

Better Exports/Imports of Slicing Data through one or more of the following:

SVG import/export
SLI Slice Layer Interface export
CLI Common Layer Interface export <- http://www.forwiss.uni-passau.de/~welisch/papers/cli_format.html
USF Universal Slice File
SLC File
SSL Statasys Layer File
GCode reference help section loaded from file

Firmware upload via AVRDude

support for powder based printers

If you have the projector at the right side of your monitor and click on a model in the 3D-View the name is to long to display and is shown in the projector and so light some resin

Improvement Requests:***************************

FEATURE-REQUESTS may be:
1.
A function to IMPORT Pictures and a coresponding  G-Codegenerator that creates the GCode for the number of Pictures Imported.
This would give people the possibility to use Other slicers like "VISCam RP" an others!!!!!!!!!



Completed**********************************

03/2015 Supports:
	Generate for entire scene
	Generate for selected model(s)

02/01/2015 -Fix Pause / Resume feature
- Flip the direction of the Debug window text from bottom-up to top-down
- CW fails to cleanly close - memory/resource issues
09/14 - serial port auto-detect
09/14 SVG export 
09/14 better slicer
09/14 In the gcode, add a passthrough command (eGeneric driver level) to allow any character/byte sequence to be passed through to the serial port
	maybe an escape sequence?

08/08/2014 - SMH - Pause will now stop on a blank screen 

 - Template that lets you print 10 versions of the same model where each one has a slightly different exposure time all in the same print job? 
	that way it would be pretty easy to find the right parameters, especially if you have a new material to test.
- crash when pressing delete with no model
- Plugins:
	If there is a plugin, check for license,
		if no license for a plugin is found, prompt for license for plugin
			only if the plugin REQUIRES a license
		plugins (if marked) can be tested for 30 days

* Ability to enable/disable licensed plug-ins
	*keep a file list of plug-ins that have been licensed, save an enabled/disabled status, use that when loading plugins


* Have CW connect via HTTPPost to server at www.buildyourownsla.com and hit a php script
   Have server address be configurable
	Things the plugin should report:
		list of Plugin ID's
		List of plugin keys
		version of CW

 * On server: have the posts go to a php script 
	post to a sql database table
	use this for statistics
	post time/data, ip address



* When the Scene node in the scene control is selected, show the volume of all objects in the scene
* Modify slicing to allow a single model to self-intersect
* add a base (flat cube / cylinder) option in support generation
* Fix the 'preview slice on Monitor' option
* Fix the Object info control
* In the machine configuration screen, allow the user to specify the visible machine controls
* Make platform walls light up when objects are not fully enclosed in platform
* Allow projector controls in the GCode sections (<PrjCmd , MonitorID , 'cmdname' >) - this will allow users to turn on/off projector during prints or make adjustments.
* In 3d view, make the left and right side parent control panels vertically scroll, (may need to override the flowpanel)
* Allow selected model to be displayed either with a bounding box, or with a selected color,
    this would imply that there is a non-selected color (probably grey).

*Embed the GCode sections in the machine configuration, this way, we can completely manage it and still have the user be able to edit
it in a controlled way, we can even have a gcode helper functionality in the gui to help users configure thier machines (Eventually).

*Can't select other build/slice profile - Fixed
*Remove the comments being sent to the Firmware
*Add homing for x/y/z in machine control section
*Support Multiple Machine types:
	Add in support for launching an external slicer (Slic3r)
	Support multiple machine configuration types (import/export skeinforge types?)
	add extruder controls (extrude,reverse,rate)
	add temp controls (hot bed, extruder(s))

*Implement projector controls 

*Add Better messages for user events
	Build started, stopped, layer, completed, etc...
*Add optional homing commands for axises
	this would help with shutter controls, as well as initial machine start

*Add better controls on control panel
*Fixed ASCII STL Loading
*Added 3d view frustrum clipping
*Add 3ds file support
*Add 3d polygon backplane clipping via normal and dp to view vector

*multiple config support
	slice profiles
*Image Anti-Aliasing
	render image at 150% value and rescale to 100%
*Update Documentation
* Fix localization
* Add preslice.gcode 
* Add screen for GCode (preslice.gcode, prelift,postlist,start,end)
* Lift fixes
	go up lift dist
	go back down (lift - layer height)
* Add lift sequence prior to first layer
* Add Coordinated Tilt / Slide support
* Add Machine and profile names to:
	slice display
	main display
* Add a control to show current slice # of total slice numbers
*Add dxf file support
*Add obj file support
